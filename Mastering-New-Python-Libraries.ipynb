For classes, `__slots__` tells you if the class uses memory optimization, which affects how you can dynamically add attributes.\n\n## `__slots__` are unique interface detail that some packages use to optimize memory usage\n\n`__slots__` is a special class attribute that tells Python to use a fixed-size array for storing instance attributes instead of a dynamic dictionary (`__dict__`). This optimization can significantly reduce memory usage and improve attribute access speed, especially for classes with many instances.\n\n### Why Libraries Use `__slots__`\n\n**Memory Optimization**: Classes with `__slots__` use 40-50% less memory per instance because they don't need to store a dictionary for each object.\n\n**Performance**: Attribute access is faster since Python can directly access the slot instead of doing a dictionary lookup.\n\n**Immutability**: Prevents adding new attributes after object creation, which can be useful for data classes and immutable objects.\n\n### How to Explore `__slots__`\n```"

The domain model represents how the library thinks about the problem space - what are the core entities, what operations are available, and how do they relate to each other.\n\nDomain-driven design principles apply to library exploration: you want to identify the ubiquitous language (naming conventions), bounded contexts (module boundaries), and core abstractions (main classes and interfaces).

By following this guide, you've learned to:\n\n**Understand the Structure**: Basic introspection and documentation exploration give you the lay of the land, while dunder attributes reveal the object's identity and contracts.\n\n**Map the Domain**: Domain model discovery helps you understand how the library thinks about the problem space, enabling you to write code that aligns with the library's intended patterns.\n\n**Explore Safely**: Defensive exploration techniques help you understand error conditions and edge cases without breaking your exploration session.\n\n**Discover Patterns**: Usage pattern analysis reveals idiomatic approaches and common workflows that may not be obvious from documentation alone.\n\n**Assess Performance**: Performance introspection helps you make informed decisions about when and how to use different library features.\n\n**Work Systematically**: The interactive exploration workflow ensures comprehensive coverage and gives you a repeatable process for any new library.\n\nThe key insight is that library exploration is not just about learning the API - it's about understanding the library's mental model and design philosophy. When you understand how a library thinks about the problem domain, you can write code that feels natural, performs well, and handles edge cases gracefully.\n\nRemember to start broad with the exploration workflow, then dive deep into the specific classes and functions that map to your domain needs. The REPL is your laboratory for understanding not just what the library can do, but how it expects to be used.\n\n**Happy exploring!** 🐍✨\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Automation Tools\n\nThis project includes several automation tools to convert the README into different formats for enhanced learning and documentation.\n\n### 📓 Interactive Jupyter Notebook\n\nThe README can be automatically converted to an interactive Jupyter notebook where:\n- **Python code blocks** become executable code cells\n- **Shell/bash commands** become terminal cells using `%%bash` magic\n- **Markdown content** becomes documentation cells\n- **Headers and structure** are preserved\n\n#### Quick Start\n```"
